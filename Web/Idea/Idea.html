      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, due to technological progress, various kinds of manufacturing using DNA as a material are being carried out. These advantages are expected to be able to function in vivo in the future because of its ability to handle on the nanoscale
        and high biocompatibility. Even in the past BIOMOD, various works considering the activity in vivo are actually proposed. Among them, attention is gathered in what is called a drug delivery system (DDS) that is able to carry by transporting drugs
        into nanoscale structures. Conventional cancer treatments include radiotherapy and drug therapy, however these problems adversely affect healthy cells other than cancer cells, so that various side effects appear. On the other hand, DDS which has
        been developed in recent years is thought to be able to treat cancer without causing side effects because it is able to pinpoint administer drug to cancer cells[1]. If that research succeeds, the technology of cancer treatment will advance greatly.
        However, it is difficult to administer drugs only to cancer cells using DDS, which is very difficult to control. In addition, there are various problems to put the nanoscale structure in the cell actually, there is no example where the artificial
        structure using DNA is moved in the living body now. We need to consider these solutions and perform verification experiments.<br>

      <h1>Our Project</h1>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose a new cancer treatment method that overcomes the current cancer treatment problems. The method proposed by us aims at direct administration to cells like DDS. The system we propose is not a premise for drug use like the conventional cancer
        treatment methods, but it causes death of cancer cells only by reaction of DNA. We named this system DCC (DNA Cancer Cancell). With current technology, as mentioned earlier it will be difficult to target only cancer cells completely. However, unlike
        medication, DCC has little effect on healthy cells.<br><br>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focused attention on ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which is energy for cell's life activity. ATP is synthesized in mitochondria, but when mitochondrial abnormality occurs, the cell synthesizes ATP in a system called glycolysis system. After that,
        when there is oxygen, many ATPs are synthesized with mitochondria[2]. Even in the absence of oxygen, it is possible to synthesize a small amount of ATP, but lactic acid is produced at the same time(Click <a href="../Simulation/Simulation.html#AboutATP">About ATP</a>        for more details). Here, when mitochondria is malfunctioning, it continues to produce lactic acid at the same time as a small amount of ATP, regardless of the presence or absence of oxygen. The cell becomes weak and leads to death by continuing
        to produce lactic acid, but in rare cases it will continue to live with carbohydrate as food. It becomes a cancer cell[3]. Cancer cells continue to live with small amounts of ATP obtained from carbohydrates as energy. Therefore, we thought that shutting
        down a small amount of ATP completely stops <a href="../Simulation/Simulation.html#Simulation">intracellular signal transduction</a> and is able to forcefully direct it to cell death. ATP is present in abundance in normal cells, but only in small
        amounts in cancer cells. We thought that it is possible to make cancer cells only die and not to affect normal cells by utilizing its characteristics. It becomes ON state absorbing ATP in the cell at the timing when the Input is input. After that,
        it turns OFF automatically when the cancer cell dies. This will minimize the burden on the cells even when our system is moving within normal cells.<br><br>

          <h2>Polymerase Reaction</h2>
          <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use the polymerase reaction as a way to absorb ATP from cells.
                The polymerase is an enzyme which configuers a nucleic acid or a chain such as DNA or RNA[7].
                In this project, we use double stranded DNA including T7 promoter squence as template,
                NTP(Nucleoside triphosphate) as substrate.
                In addition, we use T7RNA polymerase which is an enzyme and makes complementary single stranded RNA
                for a template DNA being a part of downstream of the promoter (Figure 1, Video 1).<br><br>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goals of our project are roughly divided into three. The first is to consider and simulate theory to suppress cell proliferation.<br>&nbsp;&#9312; Theory<br>&nbsp;&#9313; Simulation<br> The second one is DNA design. Because the DNA circuit designed this time is
        complicated, there are <a href="../DNADesign/DNADesign.html#variousproblems">various problems</a>. We solved these problems using mismatched base pairs.<br>&nbsp;&#9312; DNA design<br>&nbsp;&#9313; Implementation of mismatch base pair<br>&nbsp;&#9314; Experiment<br> Third is
        to do a consideration and verification experiment to move the DNA system inside the cell. In this project, we aim to use natural Escherichia coli and move the actually created DNA system.<br>&nbsp;&#9312; Method of experiment<br>&nbsp;&#9313; Experiment<br>
