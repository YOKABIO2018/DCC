              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in Our Project of Idea,
                  Yokobo aims to establish a control system of a new system transmission system using DNA circuits.
                  As an example, we will describe reduction of ATP and control of the decrease amount.
                  This page mainly explains two points.The first is about the mechanism to absorbATP,
                  the second is about the DNA circuit controlling the mechanism.

              <h1>Mechanism of Absorbing ATP</h1>
              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  use  the  polymerase  reaction  as  a  way  to  absorb  ATP  from  cells.
                  The polymerase is an enzyme which configuers a nucleic acid or a chain such as DNA or RNA[7].
                  In this project, we use double stranded DNA including T7 promoter squence as template, NTP(Nucleoside triphosphate) as substrate.
                  In addition, we use T7RNA polymerase which is an enzyme and makes complementary single stranded RNA for a template DNA being a part of downstream of the promoter (Figure 1, Video 1).<br><br>
              </p>

              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for using T7RNA Polymer is that DNA Polymerase has dNTP as a matrix and RNA Polymerase has NTP as a matrix, so RNA Polymerase can consume ATP.
              T7RNA Polymerase is useful because it detects specific base sequence and it is convenient to our project using mismatch base pair.

                <h1>DNA Circuit</h1>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  purpose of our project is to not adversely affect to normal cells.
                  So,  we implemented the ON-OFF switch in this time. Thereby when cancer cells die, the circuits in normal cells is turned off by the ON-OFF switch.
                  Thus it do not load more than necessary.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>Scheme of DNA Circuit</h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although wecan reduce ATP using the above polymerase, it has been decreasing ATP so far,
                  it is essential in vivo. Therefore, there is a need to control weight loss of ATP. T7RNA polymerase recognizes double stranded DNA such as Figure 3(a) and starts a reaction with it.
                  Therefore, we set double stranded DNA's state such as Figure 3(a) as switch ON state and single stranded DNA's state such as Figure 3(b) as switch OFF state.
                  Thereby we are able to switch ON-OFF state of polymerase reaction. In addition, the actual work in the cell is as shown in Figure 4.<br><br>
                </p>

                <figure>
                  <a href="Image/polymerase_onoff(Fig3).png" data-lightbox="fig3"><img src="Image/polymerase_onoff(Fig3).png" width="90%" height="auto"></a><br>

                  Figure 4 : Image of ON State &amp; OFF State in Cell<br><br>
                </figure>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Figure 3 wecan switch on and off by adjusting the temperature and dissociating andcoupling.
                  However, since this is actually necessary to operate in the cell, we think that it is impossible to control by heating and cooling.
                  Also, when using enzymes, it is necessaryto strictly control the tempertureand pH value, so it will be difficult to operate in the cell.
                  Therefore, we designed a DNA circuit without enzymes that utilizes only the DNA strand displacement reaction.
                  Because this reaction condition is loose, it can be expected to be used in vivo. Here is a diagram of our intended switch.
                  The area value in this figure represents the total ATP consumption by Absorber. In other words, you can control the ATP consumption by changing the AbsorberON time.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we reduced the ATP and switched the ON-OFF state and the DNA circuit became as shown in Figure 5.
                  (A double strand which is made of a and a* is T7 promoter sequence. In addition, a double strand which is made of b and b* makes RNA consuming ATP.)<br><br>

                <h2>Delay Element</h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used a seesaw gate to control time between ON state and OFF state.
                  The seesaw gate is anarithmetic element such as Figure 6 by DNA molecular reactions[9][10].
                  It produces an output for inputs exceeding a preset threshold, however it makes a delay.
                  We think that the delay is useful for adjusting time for ON→OFFstateand controlling to absorption of ATP.A right part of Figure 5 is the seesaw gate.
                  (Its simulation is described in Proof of Conceptand its advantages are described in Discussion of Application.)<br><br>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This circuit was composed of four DNA strand displacement reaction processes.
                  Each of these reaction processes is explained below.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the circuit starts by administering Input.
                        In the first process, we aimed to make the models of Signal1 and Signal2
                        using a strand displacement reaction (Figure 7, Figure 8).
                        Thereby outputed Signal1 and single stranded DCC cause hybridization and they change to double stranded.
                        In other words, DCC is changed from OFF state into ON state (Video 2).<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;T0* of Gate1 is bound with T0 of Input.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;Gate1 and Input are effectively combined.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;A part of Gage1 separates from the complex.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;&nbsp;Signal1, Signal2, and Waste are generated by separating the components.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9316;&nbsp;DCC(ON) is generated by DCC(OFF) and Signal1(Figure 8).<br><br>

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second process, we control a reacion by a gate of threshold's concentration.
                          A threshold value is decided by Threshold. Moreover, Signal2 and Threshold meet and cause
                          a strand displacement reaction and then Signal2 disappear.
                          In other words, Signal2 exceeding the Threshold's concentration is required to proceed with the reacion (Figure 9, Video 3).<br><br>

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;T3* of Threshold is bound with T3 of Signal2.<br>

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third process, we perform processing by chain reaction of strand displacement reaction
                          called seesaw gate (Figure 10, Figure 11 and Video 4).<br><br>

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;&nbsp;T3* of Gate2 is bound with T3 of Signal2.<br>

                          Gate2 made in previous steps causes a strand displacement reaction with Fuel, and Signal2 is made again.<br><br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;'&nbsp;T2* of Fule is bound with T2 of Gate3.<br>

                          The cycle such as this system is called seesaw gate. Furthermore, it refills Signal2 which is consumed in Second process
                          and outputs Releaser.
                          As described above, Threshold and seesaw gate are used to adjust time between ON and OFF of DCC.<br><br>

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final process, we aimed to change double stranded DCC into single stranded DCC
                          by dissociating Signal1 from double stranded DCC.
                          In other words, we aimed to swich a state of the circuit ON state to Off state (Figure 12, Video 5).<br><br>

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;T1 of DCC(ON) is bound with T1* of Releaser.<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;DCC(ON) and Releaser are effectively combined.<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;A part of DCC(ON) separates from the complex(It is Signal1).<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;&nbsp;DCC(OFF) and Waste are genarated by separating the components.<br><br>

                    <p id="variousproblems"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to previous four processes, we are able to switch a state of the circuit(<b>OFF → ON → OFF</b>) automatically. That’s to say, single administration of DCC is come true and it is convenient.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Figure 5 has two ploblems.
                        First, the circuit causes an undesired reaction when it starts.
                        For instance, we mention Input and DCC(OFF) here.
                        After Input is administered, Input and DCC(OFF) may happen hybridization
                        because a part of their base sequences is complementary.
                        We should change their domains not to happen hybridization.
                        However, it is impossible in principle because we should change domains of Signal1 and Gate1_under in response to Input.
                        The circuit now causes below three undesired reactions.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;Input binds with DCC(OFF)<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;Signal1 binds with Signal2<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;Input binds with Gate2<br><br>

                        Second, some double stranded DNA make T7RNA promoter and happen polymerase reaction even when the circuit is not ON state.
                        Therefore, We used <b>mismatched base pair</b> to solve these problems.
                        Mismatched base pair is described in detail in Experiment's <a href="../Experiment/Experiment.html#Material&Methods">Material & Method</a>.<br><br>

                <h1>Mismatched base pair</h1>
                <h2>What is mismatched base pair</h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&amp;T and C&amp;G in DNA base are held each other by hydrogen-bonding which is so-called Watson-Crick base pair,
                    but other than that it is reported that there are other combinations (e.g. A and G ).
                    We call this <b>Mismatched base pair</b>[11].
                    The binding power of mismatched base pair is weaker than that of Watson-Crick base pair,
                    but the binding power between G and T is stronger among mismatched base pair (We found this characteristic in try and error with NUPACK).
                    The example of mismatched base pair is shown below.
                    In the Table 1, base sequence (A) is complete complementary double stranded DNA,
                    (B) is double stranded DNA including four mismatched C-A base pairs and
                    (C) is double stranded DNA including four mismatched G-T base pairs.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We confirm whether these base sequence form double stranded DNA with NUPACK[12]
                    (a software suite for the analysis and design of nucleic acid structures) and show the result below.<br><br>

                Figure 13 : Example of Mismatch Base Pair<br><br>

                <p> As this Figure 13, it is clear that G and T are binding to each other, but in contrast A and C are not.</p>

                <h2>Use of Mismatch</h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DNA(A)(B) which we expect to be double stranded include mismatched GT base pair,
                    DNA(C) which is complete complementary to (A) and DNA(D) which is complete complementary to (B) make mismatched CA base pair.
                    Therefore, (A) is bound with (B) but (C) is not bound with (D) (Figure 14).<br><br>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We improved the circuit of Figure 5 using this character.<br>
                    In this project, we added mismatched base pair four times and added (m1)(m2)(m3)(m4) precedes the domain name.
                    We will show NUPACK's evaluation about each part of points added mismatched base pair below.<br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously stated, Input and DCC(OFF) are complementary, so they cause hybridization.
                    We added mismatched base pair here (Figure 15). Its result of NUPACK is as shown in Figure 16.
                    Red characters show desired reactions (The same hereinafter).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Signal1 and Signal2 are complementary, so they cause hybridization.
                    They should be completely complementary but unlike (m1).
                    We added mismatched base pair to Signal1 to make it be bound with DCC (Figure 17).
                    A result of NUPACK is as shown in Figure 18.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also added mismatched base pair Input and Gate2 because it starts a reaction from T3 which is toehold(Figure 19).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymerase reaction is happened because Gate2 includes T7 promoter sequence.
                    We also added mismatched base pair here to prevent T7RNA polymerase from recognizing T7 promoter sequence (Figure 20).<br><br>

                    is as shown in Figure 22.
