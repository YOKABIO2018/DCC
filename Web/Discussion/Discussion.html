        <h1>Page Overview</h1>
        <p>On this page, we mainly describe points devised when designing the system.
          Also, we examine how we can utilize in the future society, and discuss issues that arise with human beings and society.</p>

      <h2>(1) Application of Mismatched Base Pair</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        We checked up and understood the feature of mismatched base pair, and then we gave the application example. In designing DNA, it is necessary to calculate DNA’s behavior with accuracy and design base sequence as our idea, but the more complicated the
        DNA system is, the more frequently DNA do not behave as our expectation. Today, in order to solve the problem, the method that we use special secondary structure, such as hairpin loop or bulge loop (Figure 1), is used generally.
      </p>

      Figure 1 : Special Secondary Structures

      <p>
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        However, we have to take not only benefits but also defects caused by using the method into our consideration, for example of the defects of bulge loop, the longer base sequence of a part of bulge is, the more unstable secondary structure gets to be (Figure 2).
      </p>

      Figure 2 : The Structure of Bulge Loop

      <p>
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Therefore we need to use them for different purposes in accordance to the goal. We use the new method ‘Mismatched base pair’ to control DNA as accurately as possible. Mismatched GT base pair can solve a variety of problems. The primary advantage of mismatched base pair
        is high simpleness of the mechanism. In other methods, we need a knowledge and skills to keep down unintentional behaviors of DNA. In addition, we have to redesign the circulation many times as it becomes more complicated. However, by mismatched
        base pair, all we have to do is to pick up all parts where could not behave as our expectation and to add each mismatched base pair in the circulation. But there are defects in using mismatched base pair, one of which is taking a very long time to introduce it to experiments.
        Accordingly, we have no choice but to try a lot of patterns of mismatched base pair. Another one is that there are no simulation tools that can simulate using mismatched base pair now. Since mismatched base pairs can be applied in various applications, the
        development of mismatched base pair technology is thought to greatly contribute to the development of molecular robotics.
        <br><br>
      </p>

      <h2>(2) Strength of DNA Binding</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        We mentioned the strength of DNA binding. In this project we used the T7 promoter sequence, but intentionally added G-C bonds at both ends of the chain because G-C bonds are stronger in binding strength
        than A-T bonds, and double-stranded DNA is stable among Watson Crick base pairs. Especially in this time we decided that this kind of ingenuity is necessary because the binding force of double stranded DNA weakens by adding mismatched base
        pair. Figure 3 compares the case where the G-C bond is added to the edge and the case where it is not added. From Figure 3, we found that double-stranded DNA is more stable by G-C bond. This prevents unintentional behavior due to instability of the
        secondary structure.

      <h2>(3) Delay of the Seesaw Gate</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        We used a seesaw gate this time to delay the output time. The most common way to delay the reaction rate of DNA is to change the length of the toehold. Recently, regulation of reaction rate by mismatched base pair has also been reported. Compared to those,
        there is one very big advantage to adjusting the time by this seesaw gate, that adjustment can be done just by changing the density of the threshold gate. In the case of toehold or mismatched base pair, it is necessary to determine the reaction
        rate at the time of base sequence design, therefore, if we want to adjust the time according to the application, we think that it is efficient to use the seesaw gate.

      <h1>Future</h1>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say in this section that how we put ATP controller to good use in this world.
          Particularly, we focused on “cancer treatment”. Now, main cancer treatments are radiation therapy and anticancer drug, but there is a big problem in these therapies. That is they can damage not only cancer cells but also normal cells. We thought the way to damage only cancer cells and then we focused on the difference of the way of generating energy between normal cells and cancer cells. <br>
          First, we explain how normal cells generate energy.
          After having carbohydrate like bread, rice and noodle, it is decomposed into glucose.
          In brood cells incorporate glucose and then glucose is decomposed into ATP through 3 steps((1)glycolytic (2)TCA circuit (3) Electron transfer system).<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1st step is glycolytic. In cytoplasm, glucose is decomposed into pyruvate.
          A little ATP is generated by glycolytic. If there is oxygen, pyruvate is incorporated into mitochondria. 2nd step is TCA circuit. In mitochondria, pyruvate is changed to Acetyl-CoA,
          and then it is decomposed into NADH and FADH2 in TCA circuit. Like glycolytic, a little ATP is generated. 3rd step is Electron transfer system. In this system, a lot of ATP is generated.
          Therefore, normal cells can generate ATP efficiently. It’s known that cancer cells don’t use mitochondria by Warburg from 1926.
          That is, ATP is generated by only glycolytic in cancer cells. Therefore, cancer cells can’t generate ATP efficiently.
          <br><br>
      </p>

        Figure 2 : がん細胞の代謝<br><br>
      </figure>


      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we explain the required amount of ATP in cancer cells.
        Cancer cells need more ATP than normal cells because of increasing themselves. However, glycolytic isn’t efficient for generating ATP.
        It’s known that cancer cells need much glucose more than normal cells. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is cancer treatment using the characteristics : treatment of inhibiting glucose and treatment of inhibiting glycolytic.
        On these situation, absorbing ATP must have a great influence on cancer cells.
        <br><br>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we propose that ATP controller becomes an assistance for present cancer treatment using metabolic function.

      <h1>ELSI</h1>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing a system to control the amount of ATP from cell signaling system using DNA. We are conducting verification experiments in vitro at this stage,
        and the effect on the human body has not been confirmed. However, if medicines using this system are generated in the future and administered in vivo,
        adverse effects on the human body by reducing the amount of ATP are predicted.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since crime and military use using this adverse effect are predicted,
        it is necessary to evaluate it in consideration of in vivo use.
        Although this system uses DNA, it does not contradict regulations of the Cartagena Protocol and domestically established research and development stage
        because it does not do genetic modification etc.
        However, it is expected that DNA circuits will be administered to genetically modified organisms in the future.
        At the same time, in order to administer DNA, it is necessary to consider the influence on the genes of organisms.
        In that case, we need to comply with the Cartagena Protocol and other laws, we must prepare it.
