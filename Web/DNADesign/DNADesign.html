                <p> In addition, we tried to implement below three systems.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T7RNA polymerase recognizes double stranded DNA such as Figure 3(a) and starts a reaction with it.
                    Therefore, we set double stranded DNA's state such as Figure 3(a) as switch ON state
                    and single stranded DNA's state such as Figure 3(b) as switch OFF state.
                    Thereby we are able to switch ON-OFF state of polymerase reaction.
                    In addition, the actual work in the cell is as shown in Figure 4.<br><br>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purpose of our project is to not adversely affect to normal cells. So, we implemented the ON-OFF switch in this time.
                    Thereby when cancer cells die, the circuits in normal cells is turned off by the ON-OFF switch.
                    Thus it do not load more than necessary. A scheme of ON-OFF switch circuit is shown in Figure 5.<br><br>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A double strand which is made of a and a* is T7 promoter sequence.
                    In additon, a double strand which is made of b and b* makes RNA consuming ATP.
                    Moreover, we used a seesaw gate to control time between ON state and OFF state.
                    The seesaw gate is a arithmetic element such as Figure 6 by DNA molecular reactions[9][10].
                    It produces an output for inputs exceeding a preset threshold, however it makes a delay.
                    We think that the delay is useful for adjusting time for ON→OFF, and we implemented the seesaw gate.
                    A right part of Figure 5 is the seesaw gate.
                    (Its simulation is described in <a href="../Experiment/Experiment.html#DryExperiment">Dry Experiment</a> of Experiment and its advantages are described in <a href="../Discussion/Discussion.html#Discussion">Discussion</a>.)<br><br>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We designed the ON-OFF switch based on strand displacement reactions.
                    This gate was composed of four DNA strand displacement reaction processes.
                    Each of these reaction processes is explained below.<br><br>

                    <font color="red"><b>First Process:</b></font><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the circuit starts by administering Input.
                    In the first process, we aimed to make the models of Signal1 and Signal2
                    using a strand displacement reaction (Figure 7, Figure 8).
                    Thereby outputed Signal1 and single stranded DCC cause hybridization and they change to double stranded.
                    In other words, DCC is changed from OFF state into ON state (Video 2).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;T0* of Gate1 is bound with T0 of Input.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;Gate1 and Input are effectively combined.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;A part of Gage1 separates from the complex.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;&nbsp;Signal1, Signal2, and Waste are generated by separating the components.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9316;&nbsp;DCC(ON) is generated by DCC(OFF) and Signal1(Figure 8).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second process, we control a reacion by a gate of threshold's concentration.
                    A threshold value is decided by Threshold. Moreover, Signal2 and Threshold meet and cause
                    a strand displacement reaction and then Signal2 disappear.
                    In other words, Signal2 exceeding the Threshold's concentration is required to proceed with the reacion (Figure 9, Video 3).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;T3* of Threshold is bound with T3 of Signal2.<br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third process, we perform processing by chain reaction of strand displacement reaction
                    called seesaw gate (Figure 10, Figure 11 and Video 4).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;&nbsp;T3* of Gate2 is bound with T3 of Signal2.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gate2 and Signal2 are effectively combined.<br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;&nbsp;&nbsp;Releaser and Gate3 are genarated by separating the conponents.<br><br>

                    Gate2 made in previous steps causes a strand displacement reaction with Fuel, and Signal2 is made again.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;'&nbsp;T2* of Fule is bound with T2 of Gate3.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;'&nbsp;Fuel and Gate3 are effectively combined.<br>

                    The cycle such as this system is called seesaw gate. Furthermore, it refills Signal2 which is consumed in Second process
                    and outputs Releaser.
                    As described above, Threshold and seesaw gate are used to adjust time between ON and OFF of DCC.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final process, we aimed to change double stranded DCC into single stranded DCC
                    by dissociating Signal1 from double stranded DCC.
                    In other words, we aimed to swich a state of the circuit ON state to Off state (Figure 12, Video 5).<br><br>

                <p id="variousproblems"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to previous four processes, we are able to switch a state of the circuit(<b>OFF → ON → OFF</b>)
                    automatically. That’s to say, single administration of DCC is come true and it is convenient.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Figure 5 has two ploblems.
                    First, the circuit causes an undesired reaction when it starts.
                    For instance, we mention Input and DCC(OFF) here.
                    After Input is administered, Input and DCC(OFF) may happen hybridization
                    because a part of their base sequences is complementary.
                    We should change their domains not to happen hybridization.
                    However, it is impossible in principle because we should change domains of Signal1 and Gate1_under in response to Input.
                    The circuit now causes below three undesired reactions.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;Input binds with DCC(OFF)<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;Signal1 binds with Signal2<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;Input binds with Gate2<br><br>

                    Second, some double stranded DNA make T7RNA promoter
                    and happen polymerase reaction even when the circuit is not ON state.<br>
                </p>

                <p> Therefore, We used <b>mismatched base pair</b> to solve these problems.<br></p>

                <h2>What is mismatched base pair</h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&amp;T and C&amp;G in DNA base are held each other by hydrogen-bonding which is so-called Watson-Crick base pair,
                    but other than that it is reported that there are other combinations (e.g. A and G ).
                    We call this <b>Mismatched base pair</b>[11].
                    The binding power of mismatched base pair is weaker than that of Watson-Crick base pair,
                    but the binding power between G and T is stronger among mismatched base pair (We found this characteristic in try and error with NUPACK).
                    The example of mismatched base pair is shown below.
                    In the Table 1, base sequence (A) is complete complementary double stranded DNA,
                    (B) is double stranded DNA including four mismatched C-A base pairs and
                    (C) is double stranded DNA including four mismatched G-T base pairs.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We confirm whether these base sequence form double stranded DNA with NUPACK[12]
                    (a software suite for the analysis and design of nucleic acid structures) and show the result below.<br><br>
                </p>

                Figure 13 : Example of Mismatch Base Pair<br><br>

                <p> As this Figure 13, it is clear that G and T are binding to each other, but in contrast A and C are not.</p>

                <h2>Use of Mismatch</h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DNA(A)(B) which we expect to be double stranded include mismatched GT base pair,
                    DNA(C) which is complete complementary to (A) and DNA(D) which is complete complementary to (B) make mismatched CA base pair.
                    Therefore, (A) is bound with (B) but (C) is not bound with (D) (Figure 14).<br><br>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We improved the circuit of Figure 5 using this character.<br>
                    In this project, we added mismatched base pair four times and added (m1)(m2)(m3)(m4) precedes the domain name.
                    We will show NUPACK's evaluation about each part of points added mismatched base pair below.<br>
                </p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously stated, Input and DCC(OFF) are complementary, so they cause hybridization.
                    We added mismatched base pair here (Figure 15). Its result of NUPACK is as shown in Figure 16.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Signal1 and Signal2 are complementary, so they cause hybridization.
                    They should be completely complementary but unlike (m1).
                    We added mismatched base pair to Signal1 to make it be bound with DCC (Figure 17).
                    A result of NUPACK is as shown in Figure 18.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also added mismatched base pair Input and Gate2 because it starts a reaction from T3 which is toehold(Figure 19).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymerase reaction is happened because Gate2 includes T7 promoter sequence.
                    We also added mismatched base pair here to prevent T7RNA polymerase from recognizing T7 promoter sequence (Figure 20).<br><br>

                    NUPACK's evaluation of bonding strength of double stranded DNA whitch is added mismatched base pair
                    is as shown in Figure 22.
                    It includes mismatched base pair of G-T bounding, however we are able to ascertain that bouding power is kept strong.<br><br>

                    , and these problems are solved (Figure 23).<br><br>
