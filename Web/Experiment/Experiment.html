      <h1>Page Overview</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this page, we describe the methods and results of the experiments examining the DNA circuit mentioned above. Also, in order to make the DNA circuit practical, Mismatch was introduced to the array
        and experiments were carried out. The final goal was to move our designed DP gate bridge in the living body. Although this BIOMOD was not achieved because of time limits, we developed a means to conduct the experiment and predicted problems that
        may occur.

      <h2>Simulation conditions</h2>
      <p>We set the binding rate constant (kf) based on toehold length as follows.<br><br></p>
      <p>If toehold_length &#8804; 6</p>
      <p>　kf = 5.0×10<sup>n-1</sup>[M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>]</p>
      <p>else<br></p>
      <p>　kf = 3.0×10<sup>6</sup>[M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>]</p>
      <p>Where<br></p>
      <p>　n : toehold_length<br></p>

      <h2>Mismatch</h2>
      <p>We added a mismatched base pair to the DNA sequence to make the DNA circuit practical. There are two reasons.
      </p>
      <p>The first is to react strand displacement reactions in the DNA circuit correctly.</p>
      <p>The second is to not let the poly merase recognize the undesirable part.
      </p>
      <h2>What is mismatched base pair</h2>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A & T and C & G in DNA bases are held to each other through hydrogen-bonding known as Watson-Crick base pairs, but other combinations have been reported (e.g. A and G). We refer to these as mismatched
        base pairs [11]. The binding strength of mismatched base pairs is weaker than that of Watson-Crick base pairs, but the binding strength between G and T is stronger among mismatched base pairs. An example of a mismatched base pair is shown below.
        In Table 1, base sequence (A) is completely complementary to the double-stranded DNA, (B) is double-stranded DNA containing four mismatched C-A base pairs, and (C) is double-stranded DNA containing four mismatched G-T base pairs.
        <br><br>
      </p>

      <a href="Image/Example of Mismatch Base Pair.png" data-lightbox="table-1"><img src="Image/Example of Mismatch Base Pair.png" width="80%" height="auto"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure x: Example of Mismatch Base Pair</figcaption><br>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We examined whether these base sequences formed double-stranded DNA using NUPACK [12] (a software suite for analyzing and designing nucleic acid structures). The results are shown below.<br></p>
      <a href="Image/Example of Mismatched Base Pair.png" data-lightbox="table-1"><img src="Image/Example of Mismatched Base Pair.png" width="80%" height="auto"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure x: Example of Mismatched Base Pair</figcaption><br>

      <p>As shown in Figure 13, G and T clearly bind to each other, while A and C do not.</p>

      <h2>Use of Mismatches</h2>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DNA (A) and (B), which we expect to be double-stranded, contain mismatched GT base pairs, DNA (C), which is completely complementary to (A), and DNA (D), which is completely complementary to (B),
        form mismatched CA base pairs. Therefore, (A) is bound to (B) while (C) is not bound to (D) (Figure 14).</p>
      <a href="Image/Use of Mismatches.png" data-lightbox="table-1"><img src="Image/Use of Mismatches.png" width="80%" height="auto"></a><br>
      <figcaption>Figure x: Use of Mismatches</figcaption>

      <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We improved the circuit shown in Figure 5 using this property. In this project, we added four mismatched base pairs and added (m1), (m2), (m3), and (m4) preceding the domain names. We show the
        NUPACK results for each added mismatched base pair below. (m1) Input & Absorber (OFF) As previously stated, Input and (OFF) are complementary and thus hybridize. We added a mismatched base pair here (Figure 15). The results of NUPACK as analysis
        are shown in Figure 16. Red characters show the desired reactions (same hereinafter).<br><br>
      </p>

      <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m2) Signal1 & Signal2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Signal1 and Signal2 are complementary and thus hybridize. They should be completely complementary, but unlike (m1). We added
        a mismatched base pair to Signal1 for binding with Absorber (Figure 17). The results of NUPACK as analysis are shown in Figure 18.<br><br>
      </p>

      <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m3) Input & Gate2<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also added mismatched base pair Input and Gate2 because this starts a reaction from T3, which is the toehold (Figure 19).<br><br>

      </p>
      <a href="Image/(m3) Input & Gate2.png" data-lightbox="table-1"><img src="Image/(m3) Input & Gate2.png" width="80%" height="auto"></a><br>
      <figcaption>Figure x: (m3) Input & Gate2</figcaption>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m4) Gate2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The polymerase reaction occurred because Gate2 contains the T7 promoter sequence. We also added mismatched base pair here to prevent T7 RNA polymerase from
        recognizing the T7 promoter sequence (Figure 20).<br><br></p>
      <a href="Image/(m4) Gate2.png" data-lightbox="table-1"><img src="Image/(m4) Gate2.png" width="80%" height="auto"></a><br>
      <figcaption>Figure x: (m4) Gate2</figcaption>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new scheme of the circuit containing mismatched base pairs is shown in Figure 21.<br><br></p>
      <a href="Image/Scheme of ON-OFF Switch Circuit Added Mismatch.png" data-lightbox="table-1"><img src="Image/Scheme of ON-OFF Switch Circuit Added Mismatch.png" width="80%" height="auto"></a><br>
      <figcaption>Figure x: Scheme of ON-OFF Switch Circuit Added Mismatch</figcaption>

      <p> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is predicted to reduce undesired reactions. NUPACK's evaluation of bonding strength of double-stranded DNA containing a mismatched base pair is shown in Figure 22. This includes the mismatched
        base pair G-T; however, we found that binding strength remained strong.</p>

      <figcaption>Figure x: NUPACK Evaluation of Gate1 and Gate2</figcaption>


      <p> Additionally, the T7 RNA promoter disappears, except that the circuit is in the ON state when the mismatched base pair is added; these problems were solved as shown in Figure 23.<br><br></p>

      <h2>Type of Strands</h2>
      <p>We designed the strands shown in Figures 5-9.<br><br>

      <h2>T7promotor mutation</h2>
      <p>1.Dliute<br></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We diluted each strand until reaching the desired concentration, as shown in Table x below. The experiment was performed at 20°C in Tris - EDTA buffer supplemented with 12.5mM MgCl2.
      <br><br></p>
      <p>2.Annealing<br></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Thermal cycler ( ASTEC325; GeneAtlas ), we annealed each DNA from 95 to 20°C ( - 1°C/min) after heating at 95°C .
        <br><br></p>

      <p>3.Reporter intensity measurements<br></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a spectrofluoremeter (FP - 8300; JASCO) , We measured the Reporter intensity for Xh with X-min intervals.
        <br><br></p>

      <p>4.Reaction confirmation<br></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We applied FRET to confirm how much output was released. For confirmation of ON - OFF reaction, we qualify 5 - FAM for 5’ terminal of Signal1 and BHQ1 for 3’ terminal of Absorber. When the Absorber
        is in the ON state, the 5 - FAM did not fluoresce since the Reporter of 5-FAM was Absorbed by BHQ1.On the other hand, when it is in the OFF state, the Absorber of 5-FAM became detectable because the distance between the 5 - FAM and BHQ1 molecules
        increased (FigZa) . Also, for confirmation of delay element, we qualify Cy5 for 5’terminal of releaser and BHQ2 for 3’terminal of releaser_under.When Gate2 reacted with Signal,the Releaser of Cy5 became detectable because the distance between
        the Cy5 and BHQ 2 molecules increased(FigZb).
        <br><br>
      </p>

      <h2>T7promotor mutation</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T7 RNA polymerase recognizes the T7 promoter sequence and synthesizes RNA that will be a copy of the downstream sequence using ATP in buffer. This experiment was designed to prevent recognition of
        the T7 promoter by using mismatched base pairs. Therefore, we injected the T7 promoter containing mismatches into Escherichia coli with T7 RNA polymerase and examined whether polymerase recognized the sequence.<br><br>
      </p>

      <h2>Experiment method</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experiments are performed in E. coli using cyclic DNA known as a plasmid. The T7 promoter sequence containing a mismatch should be incorporated into the plasmid sequence, as well as a downstream sequence
        that produces a green fluorescent protein known as GFP. This plasmid is introduced into E. coli, and GFP fluorescence is observed.　私たちは段階的にミスマッチを増やすことによって、T7promotorが配列を認識し始める要因を調べることにした。<br><br>
      </p>

      <h2>Experiment contents</h2>
      <h3>&#9312;Production of mutated plasmids</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we designed a mismatch sequence changed at one position at the end of the T7 promoter sequence.<br><br></p>

      <figcaption>Figure x: Mutation T7 promotor sequence</figcaption>
      <a href="Image/Mutation T7 promotor sequence.png" data-lightbox="table-1"><img src="Image/Mutation T7 promotor sequence.png" width="80%" height="auto"></a><br>

      <p> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was done to maintain a similar bond strength as the original two DNAs. Next, a plasmid containing the designed DNA sequence was extracted and amplified by PCR. Water, dNTPs, primers, templates,
        KODFXNEO, and other components were prepared in a total volume of 50 μL mutated plasmids were synthesized in 3 h. Thereafter, because plasmids with mutation and no mutation were present in the solution, the original plasmid without mutation was
        digested with DPN (enzyme). The reaction solution contained DPN (1 μm),·TBuffer X 10 (1 μm), Solution (8 μm) Mutate, which was mixed with the plasmid and introduced into E. coli for plasmid amplification. Escherichia coli used at this time was
        named as DHSr, which does not contain T7 RNA polymerase, and was used to increase the amount of plasmid. The plasmid was mixed with competent cells on ice and incubated for 30 min. Incubate for 30 s, followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 h. The
        solution was transferred to a culture dish containing medium and the cells were grown overnight. Using a MiniPrep kit, the plasmid was extracted from E. coli and measured. Sequencing was carried out to confirm the presence of the mutation.<br><br>

      <h3>&#9313;Confirmation of reaction of mutated plasmid</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the extracted mutant plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) containing T7 RNA polymerase. In the same manner as in &#9312;, the plasmid containing the mutation was introduced into E.
        coli and cultured for 1 day, after which GFP fluorescence was confirmed.<br><br>

      <h2>&#9679;T7promotor Experiment</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the above results, when one part of the end of the sequence was changed, polymerase recognized this sequence. We could not conduct further experiments during this BIOMOD period, but based
        on this experiment, we reviewed a previous study which added a mismatch to the promoter sequence. According to the paper, promoter sequences were found to be meaningful for enzymes in each sequence (See the figure from the paper). The mutation
        was added to position 0, which is a sequence that affects the synthesis rate from mRNA to protein. In the previous study, a mutation was inserted between position -17 of the promoter sequence and position -5, followed by analysis. Particularly,
        mismatches were introduced from -9 to -5; based on these results, the optimal mismatch base can be introduced into our promoter sequence.<br><br></p>

      <h2>&#9679;Experiment in vivo</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final goal is to move our designed DP gate bridge in the living body. Although this BIOMOD could not be achieved because of the time limit, we developed an experimental method and predicted problems
        that may arise.
      </p>
      <h2>Outline of experiment</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DPgate bridge is introduced into E. coli and absorption of ATP is detected. Additionally, differences in the reaction time and whether the DNA circuit is working well are examined.
      </p>
      <h2>Experiment method</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plasmid is introduced into E. coli (BL21 (DE3)) by electroporation or other similar methods. The electroporation method involves electric pulsing of the cell membrane to create pores, through
        which DNA enters the cell. Other methods can also be used to deliver DNA into cells. Next, the movement of the circuit will be tracked by measuring the change in the amount of ATP in the cell over time.
      </p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unknown whether the DNA circuit actually moves. As E. coli divides over time, the number of circuits in the cell will decrease. In the case of a plasmid, a process that divides the plasmid simultaneously
        occurs when E. coli divides, but whether the same process can be added to the DNA circuit is unknown. As a solution, the rate of proliferation of E. coli slows at low temperature; thus, if the cells are cultured at a low temperature, the influence
        of intracellular dilution can be suppressed.
