                <h1>T7 promotor sequence variation</h1>
                <h2>Outline of experiment</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  T7 RNA polymerase recognizes the T7 promoter sequence and synthesizes RNA that will be a copy of the downstream sequence using ATP in buffer,
                  but in this experiment it was designed not to recognize T7 promoter by using mismatched base pair ing.
                  Therefore, we inject T7 promoter containing mismatch into E. coli with T7 RNA polymerase and test whether polymerase recognizes the sequence.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>Experiment method</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Experiments are performed in E. coli using cyclic DNA called plasmid.
                  Incorporate a T7 promoter sequence that contains a mismatch in the sequence in the plasmid and design a plasmid that incorporates a sequence downstream of it that produces a green fluorescent protein called GFP called RNA.
                  This is introduced into Escherichia coli, and observation is made as to whether or not fluorescence can be seen by generating GFP.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>Experiment contents</h2>
                <h3>&#9312;Production of mutated plasmids</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Firstly, we designed a mismatch sequence that changed one position at the end of the T7 promoter sequence. The reason for making it at one end is to make bond strength not too weak from the original two DNAs.
                  Next, a plasmid containing the designed DNA sequence is extracted. PCR method is used to grow E. coli. · Water · Materials required for PCR · dNTPs · primers · templates · KODFXNEO or more are mixed so that the total is 50 μm and waiting for 3 hours to synthesize mutated plasmids.
                  Thereafter, since plasmids with mutation and no mutation are present in the solution, the original plasmid without mutation is digested with DPN (enzyme).
                   · DPN (1 μm) · TBuffer X 10 (1 μm) · Solution (8 μm) Mutate the inside of the solution with plasmid only, then introduce it into E. coli and increase plasmid.
                   Escherichia coli used at this time is called DHSr, there is no T7 RNA polymerase, it is used to increase the amount of plasmid. Place the plasmid in competent cells on ice and let stand for 30 minutes.
                   Incubate for 30 seconds and wait at 37 ° C for 1 hour.Transfer the solution to the medium on a dish and wait overnight. Using a MiniPrep (kit called), only extract plasmid from E. coli and measure the amount extracted.
                   After that, sequencing was carried out to confirm whether mutation was contained.<br><br>
                 </p>
                 <h3>&#9313;Confirmation of reaction of mutated plasmid</h3>
                 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                   Next, the extracted mutant plasmid is introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) having T7 RNA polymerase.
                   In the same way as in &#9312;, plasmid with mutation was introduced into E. coli and cultured for 1 day, after which fluorescence by GFP was confirmed.
                 </p>

                <h2>Experiment result</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Production of mutated plasmid by &#9312; succeeded without problems.
                  Successful introduction into E. coli at &#9312;, the following results were obtained.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  From now on, fluorescence can be confirmed, indicating that polymerase recognizes mutated T7 promoter sequence.
                </p>

                <h2>Consideration</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Based on the above results, it was found that when one part of the end of the sequence was changed, polymerase recognized this sequence.
                    We could not do any further experiments within this BIOMOD period, but based on this experiment we investigated the paper which adds a mismatch to the promoter sequence.
                    According to the paper, promoter sequences were found to be meaningful for enzymes in each sequence.
                    (See the figure, from the paper.) It was found that this time, the mutation was added to the position 0 part, which is a sequence related to the synthesis rate from mRNA to protein.
                    In the previous study, mutation was inserted between position -17 of the promoter sequence and position -5, and an experiment was conducted. In particular,
                    there are data that mismatched from -9 to -5, and based on these results I think to think of introducing the optimal mismatch base into our promoter sequence.

                  The final goal is to actually move the DP gate bridge designed by us in the living body.
                  Although this BIOMOD can not be achieved due to time limit, it gives a means to do the experiment and problems that may occur.
                </p>
                <h2>Outline of experiment</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Introduce DPgate bridge into E. coli and see whether ATP is successfully absorbed.
                  Also, by the action of the timer, observe whether the reaction ends with time difference and check whether the DNA circuit is working well or not.
                </p>
                <h2>Experiment method</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  It is introduced into Escherichia coli (BL21 (DE3)) by electroporation or the like.
                  The electroporation method is a method in which a cell is microscopically drilled with electric pulses into a cell membrane and DNA is sent into the hole.
                  It is thought that other methods can also deliver DNA into cells. After that, we will grasp the movement of the circuit by measuring the change with time of the amount of ATP in the cell.
                </p>
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  As a problem, it is unknown whether or not the DNA circuit actually moves. As E. coli divides over time, the amount of circuits in the cell decreases.
                  In the case of a plasmid, a function that divides the plasmid simultaneously is carried when E. coli divides, but whether the same function is added to the DNA circuit is a problem.
                  As one of the solutions, the rate of proliferation of Escherichia coli slows down at a certain temperature, so if it is kept at that temperature, the influence of intracellular dilution can be suppressed.
